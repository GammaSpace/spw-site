**Based on our findings, SPW demands that agencies:** 
- Provide peers with a living wage and better control over their working conditions.
- Drop racist, ableist, and [classist](/glossary#classism) standards of "professionalism".
- Stop [criminalizing](/glossary#criminalization) and oppressing drug users and people who have survived incarceration.
- Transform workplace cultures that discriminate against all peer workers, but most of all Black and Indigenous peers.
