## Treaty Responsiblities

One of the ways we tried to live our commitments to equity and justice on the steering committee was to begin each of our meetings with time to learn about and reflect on the treaties that are the true laws of this land. 

In our early days, we focused on the Dish with One Spoon, using books, articles, videos and podcasts by Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee Elders, scholars, thinkers, and community-builders. We then learned about the Two Row Wampum from Haudenosaunee resources. 

Beyond our specific treaty responsibilities, we also paid attention to guidance from Indigenous researchers from across so-called Canada to support us in refusing the most colonial methods of gathering knowledge and stories. We checked in with project consultant Les Harper at key points throughout our process to get on how to work in solidarity with Indigenous health promotion and harm reduction strategies. 

Later in our process, we tried to connect our understanding of our treaty responsibilities, which will always be incomplete, to our everyday lives and commitments within and outside the project. We started to think together about what a world without the need for mainstream social work could be.
