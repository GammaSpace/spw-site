**Julia Walter** (she/her) identifies as a settler, cis-woman, who passes as white, and comes from mixed race identity. She has a continuous complicated involvement with the psychiatric industrial complex which has led her to her work and activism in various radical mental health spaces and practices. She has lived experience with using drugs and being unhoused. Her commitment and connection to this work have included being hired for her lived experiences, although never under the title of a ‘peer’ role. The idea of inclusion, and exploitation of those who come to the work with lived experience, is one of the things that she was,  and continues to be invested in exploring and agitating. She now works as a therapist and community researcher.
