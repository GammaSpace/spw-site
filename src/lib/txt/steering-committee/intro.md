## The steering committee is the heart and soul of the SPW project. 

The SPW steering committee includes six people with recent experience working from their lived/living expertise; a research coordinator; a representative from Working for Change; and a representative from George Brown College. 

Each one of us identifies as a survivor and/or person with lived/living experience of contact with the oppressive social service system. More importantly, each of us is committed to treating each other with dignity, respect and love.  

**According to our Terms of Reference, the purpose of our steering committee was to:**

- Shape the SPW project through its three year duration
- Ensure that the project promotes equity and justice for so-called “peer workers”  

All major decisions in the SPW project were made by [consensus](/glossary#consensus). We also prioritized our connection to each other above all else.

In SPW, we believe that change is relational - we can’t seek justice in the world unless we can live it with one another. The community we built on the steering committee is a permanent outcome of the project - our relationships with one another model how to work together across difference.
