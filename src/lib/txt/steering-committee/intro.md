## The steering committee is the heart and soul of the SPW project. 

This committee includes six people with recent experience working from their lived/living expertise in their own communities; a research coordinator and community member representative; a representative from Working for Change; and a representative from George Brown College. 

Each person involved is committed to social justice and equity for peer workers, and identifies as a survivor and/or person with lived/living experience of contact with the oppressive social service system. 

**According to our Terms of Reference, the purpose of our steering committee was to:**

- Shape the SPW project through its three year duration
- Ensure that the project promotes equity and justice for so-called “peer workers”  

All major decisions in the SPW project were made collaboratively by the steering committee. We made our decisions by [consensus](/glossary#consensus). We also prioritized our connection, respect and love for each above above all other elements of the project, because we believe that building a new world means changing the way we relate to one another.
