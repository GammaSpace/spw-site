### Supporting Peer Work (SPW) is a resource site for the community-guided participatory action research project of the same name, which did our research in what is now called Toronto, Canada from 2020-2023. 

This project was steered by a committee of workers with [lived/living expertise](/glossary#lived-living-expertise) - also known as “[peers](/glossary#peer-worker)". We offer our [research reports](/report) and [tools for organizational change](/questions-for-agencies) free to view, download and share widely.

The Supporting Peer Work project documented how [“low barrier” social service agencies](/glossary#low-barrier-social-service-agency) treat peers.

**We found that workers with lived/living expertise:**

- Are forging new and vital paths for community empowerment.
- Work best when they are trusted, respected, and resourced on their own terms. 

**But that most agencies:**

- Falsely believe they value community knowledge and lived/living expertise.
- Misunderstand the powerful, transformative work of peers. 
- Force peer workers to follow policies and practices that undermine their unique skills and contributions. 

We’ve posted select research highlights on this site for quick reference, and we encourage further reading, sharing, dialogue and citing of the full findings. Please read our [reports](/report), learn about our [Steering Committee](/steering-committee) and reach out to connect with us about our ongoing work to create equity and justice for peers.
