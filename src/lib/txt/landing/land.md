The SPW research took place on the occupied territories of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Wendat, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River, among other Indigenous nations and communities. Toronto, from the Mohawk word Tkaronto, is home to the original peoples of this land, as well as Indigenous peoples from across the globe, including those whose ancestors were brutally stolen from Africa through the trans-Atlantic enslavement system, and those who were forced to migrate due to [white supremacy](/glossary#white-supremacy), [capitalism](/glossary#capitalism), and other forms of structural oppression. 

Whether we benefit from and/or are oppressed by these linked [systems of domination](/glossary#systems-of-domination), we must oppose them. In Toronto, we have the direct guidance of multiple [treaties](/glossary#treaty), including [Treaty 13](/glossary#treaty-13), the [Dish with One Spoon](/glossary#dish-with-one-spoon) and the [Two-Row Wampum](/glossary#two-row-wampum). These treaties are the true laws of this land, but they are repeatedly broken by governments, corporations, agencies, institutions and individuals. SPW has aspired to understand our treaty responsibilities as much as possible throughout our process.
