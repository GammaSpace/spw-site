## The Full Report
Our 50-page report provides the full documentation of our research process and the values we brought to our work. It defines peer support work as a **radical practice** and shares stories of resistance and innovation by people working in peer positions. It also documents the oppression that peers face at social service agencies, and explores how managers, supervisors and other decision makers justify this oppression. It concludes with ideas and strategies for change. *Read this if you want to really understand the SPW project and think deeply about our questions and demands.*
