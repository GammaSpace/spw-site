SPW did our work on the occupied territories of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Wendat, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River, among Indigenous nations and communities. What is now called Toronto is now home to Indigenous peoples from this land and across the globe, including those whose access to their original territories and teachings was disrupted by the brutality of the trans-Atlantic enslavement system, **white supremacy, capitalism**, and other forms of **structural oppression**.  

Whether we benefit from and/or are oppressed by these linked **systems of power**, we must oppose them. In Toronto, we have the direct guidance of multiple **treaties**, including the **Dish with One Spoon** and the **Two-Row Wampum**. SPW aspired to be accountable to our treaty responsibilities throughout our process.
