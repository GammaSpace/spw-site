### Supporting Peer Work (SPW) is a resource site for the community-guided participatory action research project of the same name, which did our research in what is now called [Toronto, Canada](/#treaty) from 2020-2023. 

This project was steered by a committee of [people with lived/living expertise](/glossary#lived-living-expertise) - also known as “[peer workers](/glossary#peer-worker)". We offer our [research reports](/report) and [tools for organizational change](/questions-for-agencies) free to view, download and share widely.

The Supporting Peer Work project documented how [“low barrier” social service agencies](/glossary#low-barrier-social-service-agency) treat peer workers.

**We found that most agencies:**

- Falsely believe they value community knowledge and lived/living expertise.
- Misunderstand the powerful, transformative work of peers. 
- Practically force peer workers to follow policies and practices that undermine their unique  skills and contributions. 

**And that workers with lived/living expertise:**

- Are forging new and vital paths for community empowerment.
- Should be trusted, respected and resourced on their own terms. 

We’ve posted select research highlights on this site for quick reference, and we encourage further reading, sharing, dialogue and citing of the full findings.
